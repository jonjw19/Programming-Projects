Programming-Projects
====================

My various code projects.


I'm brand new to this github thing so please don't judge me on the layout of this readme,it
will get prettier when I'm more experienced.


Just a little explanation of my current Directories:

<h2>Assembly Language Homework Programs</h2>

These are my solutions to all the IBM assembly programs I had to write in my assembler class,
some of the most and least fun I have while programming, but I suppose thats to be expected when
programming in a language older than me.

This one probably won't be updated again, as I currently have no plans to take another course 
similair to this one.

<h2>Project Euler Solutions:</h2>

I'm putting these up for two reasons,to act as code samples for interviews and prospective
employeers, and to back up my little victories in the case of some sort of hard drive failure.

Please don't use these as a way to cheat yourself out of the opportunity of solving them yourself,
It really ruins the spirit of the site, and you learn nothing.

Either way heres a few things you might notice:

1. I do use break sometimes, please understand I know how to use seperate methods and exception
handling, but sometimes break doesn't create an issue with readability or have a potential issue
with my code.  I don't plan on using break for code that will impact my career.

2. My solution may not be the best one, or the fastest, but I promise theres a good reason. My goal
is to use the bare minimum of outside help in order to forge my algorithms for these problems.
Sometimes that means just throwing myself at it or using my whiteboard, other times that means looking
at math forumlas on wikipedia.  What it NEVER means, is that I used someone elses code, these are for
fun, and if I need to cheat to beat something, then I wasn't having enough fun anyway.

3. I try to comment these for readability, if your reading my code and can't figure something out,
then I screwed up and I would love for you to let me know. (jonjw19@gmail.com)

4. Sometimes my solution was garbage and I have found a cooler way to solve a problem, if I do this
there may be some version 2.0's or something, we will see.

<h2> Websites </h2>

At this moment only my resume website is in here, but I hope eventually it will be the home of other
test projects as well.  Expect a database driven site soon.
